### Hi there 👋

I’m a computer scientist 🧑‍💻 currently working with **Big Data** 📊 and **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖, developing solutions based on machine learning, natural language processing 🗣️, and intelligent automation ⚙️. I have experience in software analysis, requirements gathering, as well as delivering lectures 🎤 and training, using various AI-focused tools and programming languages 💻.

- 🔭 Currently I work in the data area.
- 🌱 I'm studying statistics and machine learning, I like to explore quantum computers too.
- 🧠 I like neuroscience, cognitive computing, personality psychology, future skills, health projects, and political initiatives.

I founded [NeuroQuest AI](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi), a startup focused on cognitive solutions and AI applied to psychology 🧠🤖. I dedicate my free time to developing innovative AI solutions tailored to this field 🚀💡 — many of which we release as open source to contribute to the tech and research community 🌍.
