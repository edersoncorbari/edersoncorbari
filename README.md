### Hi there 👋

I’m a Computer Scientist 🧑‍💻 working in the intersection of Data Science, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence, focused on transforming data into business value 📈. I design and deliver data-driven solutions using machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent automation, supporting decision-making, efficiency gains, and scalable digital strategies.

I have experience across the full data lifecycle — from data analysis and requirements elicitation to model development, deployment, and knowledge transfer, including executive briefings, lectures, and professional training 🎤. I work with diverse programming languages and AI-centric platforms to bridge technical depth with business outcomes.

- 🔭 Currently working in Data & Analytics, supporting strategic and operational decisions.
- 🌱 Deepening my knowledge in statistics, machine learning, and exploring quantum computing from a data and optimization perspective.
- 🧠 Interests include cognitive computing, neuroscience applied to decision-making, personality psychology, future workforce skills, health analytics, and data-driven public policy initiatives.

I founded [NeuroQuest AI](https://github.com/NeuroQuestAi), a startup focused on cognitive solutions and AI applied to psychology 🧠🤖. I dedicate my free time to developing innovative AI solutions tailored to this field 🚀💡 — many of which we release as open source to contribute to the tech and research community 🌍.
